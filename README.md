# 📚 Technical Writing Portfolio – Elizabeth June Davis

Welcome! This repository showcases a selection of my work as a **Technical Writer**, including developer documentation, decision guides, implementation guides, UX research, and more. 
It demonstrates both my **depth in cloud/software documentation** and my **range across audiences**—from developers to business stakeholders.

## 🖊️ About Me
I’m a Technical Writer with 9+ years of experience in software, cloud services, and engineering documentation.  
I specialize in:
- **Developer documentation**: APIs, SDKs, integration & implementation guides  
- **Content design & strategy**: Information architecture, docs-as-code workflows, structured authoring (DITA, DocBook, AEM, Markdown, XML)  
- **AI/ML/LLM documentation**: Generative AI solutions, machine learning lifecycle docs, model deployment, and decision guides for emerging technologies  
- **Multimedia & video content**: Tutorial videos, getting started walkthroughs, decision-support demos, and knowledge base training  
- **Technical storytelling**: Research studies, conceptual overviews, and business-to-technical translation  

I’ve written for **AWS, Intuit, and other enterprise technology companies**, and I love creating documentation that makes complex systems approachable.
